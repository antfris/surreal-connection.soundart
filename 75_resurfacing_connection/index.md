patchNotes: "vcv. turing machine out to quantizer, quant to shift register, register first three outs to three oscillators pitch via sample and holds for each osc , last 5 shift registers out to the oscillators modulation amounts. gate seq was recorded from turing out 1 so recorded random gate sequeces. three seqs to each oscilator so each osc has a shift registered pitch and a unique 15 step gate pattern. shift register shifts every four beats. switch switching a between 0 volts and the corresponding amount of volts for 5, 7 and 12 semitones switching every 17 beats is transposing the quantizer meaning different scale, quant is set by default to c min pentatonic. bass triangle through filter and adsr plus sub sine voct seq by semitone adder switch constants. gate seq recorded from turningn machine and slightly modified going into trummor kick and noise with gate seq set to 2.32. decay of noise modulated by turing out. anoter quant in from turing out two and out to another shift register then going  1 and 3 out to pitch of two fmops with 2 and 4 out to fdbk amount, gates for fmop from turing out 3 and 7. all except beats going through reverb with manual mods on decay and mod depth."
