patchNotes: "done in mi rack entirely. rampage with sample and hold noise and attenuverter creating random length rhythm which is then triggering strum on on mutable rings as well a sample and hold that is going to every cv input on rings, generating a random sound at random timings, only thing not being randomised is the voct on rings. rampage chanel b with another sample and hold creating random length but this time with cv output of b going to plaits timbre and making random timed modulation on a drone. second plaits with standard lfo controling harm then going into reverb and out to mix. whole mix going to reverb then out to record."
