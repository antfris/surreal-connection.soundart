patchNotes: "dexter on mix 7th chord just playing static note with manual mods on level of op2 and then op3 is being modulated by permutations so when op 2 is manual moded op3 mods come in. m32 going thoguh qpas and mimeophon giving a slight pitch shifting effect. marbles random gate going to platis on snare mode with harmonics turned all the way down and occasionally bringing is which gives a slight noise feel to the random snare. bass is basal with 16 step sequence. noise going into mixer straight with a volume knob and lots of reverb."
